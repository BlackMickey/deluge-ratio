Ever wanted to track your total uploads, downloads, and overall share ratio in Deluge?

Now you can!

[[./ratio_screenshot.png]]

The status bar format is simple:

   share ratio = (total uploads / total downloads), each in gigabytes (GiB)

* Preferences
** Save download and upload totals on quit
By default you save your download and upload totals across Deluge
sessions.

Your totals are also saved about once a minute so you shouldn't lose
much of your totals data if Deluge or the computer suddenly crashes.
** Reset download and totals
If you want to start your totals from scratch, click this button.
* Future
- Use a custom icon instead of gtk stock PLUS symbol.
